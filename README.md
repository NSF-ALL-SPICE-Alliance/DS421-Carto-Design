## 🌍 Course Overview

**DS 421: Cartographic Design** is the second course in the **GIS Certificate Program**, following Foundations and leading into advanced spatial analysis and capstone work. This course blends technical skills and design thinking, focusing on how visual choices in maps influence understanding, communication, and impact.

Students will gain hands-on experience building maps in **R**, **ArcGIS Online**, and other modern tools — while engaging critically with questions like:

> *Why do so many “country heatmaps” just reflect population size?  
> What makes a map misleading? What makes it beautiful?*
